## Introduction:
The idea of this project was to create a Unity application, in which we would import some point cloud data and render it. We were given a bunch of point cloud data files from which we chose those that ran the best on Unity; some of the files were quite large. Another goal was to possibly export the model using glTF. We didn't end up implementing this.

## Additional tools or Unity Plugins used:
- Pcx | https://github.com/keijiro/Pcx
  * Pcx is the tool we used to import and render the point cloud data in Unity. One small issue we noticed was that; as mentioned on the Github page, Pcx only accepts files in PLY format, while the files given to us were either LAS or E57 format. We used other tools to convert these to PLY in order to fix this issue.
